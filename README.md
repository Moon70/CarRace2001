# Car Race 2001

After putting most of my old Amiga-sources here on GitHub, i was thinking if there is anything even older which i could share here, too.

In 1989, the German Commodore 64 magazine '**64´er**' called for creating a BASIC program, with a maximum length of 20 lines, which was the only rule as far as i remember.

I did BASIC for a while and just had started with assembly, so i thought, why not combine that to create a little game. Maybe because i´d just finished reading Arthur C. Clarke´s **2001: A Space Odyssey**, i called the game Car Race 2001. Why not.

It was finished in time, sent to that magazine, and, too bad, rejected. Ha ha.

I found (created?) three reasons (not to say excuses) to share it here:

1. It shows how easy it can be to combine BASIC and assemby, i miss that on modern languages
2. The assembly-part, although very short and simple, uses self-modifying code, which was not evil to that time. Is it today?
3. FORF=XTOYSTEPP sounds somehow Klingon, right?     -->  FOR f = x TO y STEP p
   Whitespace is overvalued, isn´t it?



To play the game load **CarRace2001.gz**, a compressed D64 disc-image, into your favourite C64-emulator.

Use joystic in port 2 to pilot the car.

Rules: Just stay on the road.

Sound support: yes of course




#### BASIC

Two merged screenshots instead of a textfile, because of the special characters. On C64, these characters were used, for example, to clear the screen or move the cursor.

The first lines contain the car-graphics and the assembly-subroutine.
